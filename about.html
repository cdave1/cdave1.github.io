title: About Me
---

<br />I live and work in Wellington, New Zealand.  I also frequently spend time in the San Francisco Bay Area on business.<br /><br />
I'm Founder/CTO of <a href="http://www.playcomo.com">PlayCoMo</a>, a startup based in the USA that makes mobile phone games. I also make indie games as <a href="http://twitter.com/hackdirt/">@hackdirt</a>.<br /><br />

Before PlayCoMo I was lead developer at education startup <a href="http://www.learningsource.co.nz">Learning Source</a>.  Before that I wrote financial modelling software for big faceless corporations.<br/><br />
