title: About Me
---

<br />I live and work in Wellington, New Zealand.  I also frequently spend time in the San Francisco Bay Area on business.<br /><br />
I am currently working on new projects.<br /><br />

I was previously co-founder of a <a href="http://ycombinator.com">Y Combinator</a> funded startup called SocialBox.<br /><br />

Prior to this, I was founder and CTO of <a href="http://www.playcomo.com">PlayCoMo</a>, a startup based in the USA that makes mobile phone games. 

Before PlayCoMo I was lead developer at education startup <a href="http://www.learningsource.co.nz">Learning Source</a>.  Before that I wrote financial modelling software for big faceless corporations.<br/><br />

I also make indie games as <a href="http://twitter.com/hackdirt/">@hackdirt</a>.<br /><br />
