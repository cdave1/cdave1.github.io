<p style="font-size: 12pt">

I mainly live and work in Wellington, New Zealand:<br /><br />

However, I've been lucky enough to have lived in the San Francisco Bay Area, in California, USA, since 2014.  I was initially in Mountain View, before moving to Redwood City, and now I'm in San Mateo.<br /><br />

Since early 2014, I have been working on a project called <a href="http://www.vastvr.com">Vast</a>. Vast is a tool for crafting 3D objects and environments directly in VR. I've also been working at <a href="http://www.icracked.com">iCracked</a>, in the San Francisco Bay Area, on a soon to be announced hardware project.<br /><br />

In 2013 I was co-founder of a company called SocialBox.  We got funded by <a href="http://ycombinator.com">Y Combinator</a> for the W14 batch.<br /><br />

Between 2010 and 2013, I was co-founder and CTO of <a href="http://www.playcomo.com">PlayCoMo</a>, a company that makes mobile phone games.  I ran the company's office out of Wellington, New Zealand, managing our staff in five different countries (USA, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Indonesia).<br /><br />

Before PlayCoMo I made indie mobile phone games under the moniker <a href="https://twitter.com/hackdirt/">@hackdirt</a>. I also built iOS apps for various companies in New Zealand, Australia, and the UK (including Subway NZ, Pizza Hut, Wagamama, and Royal Bank of Scotland).
<br /><br />
From 2007 to 2008 I was lead developer at awesome education software startup <a href="https://www.arlo.co">Arlo</a>. Arlo powers a training platform for a growing number of schools and companies in New Zealand and Australia, such as <a href="http://events.xero.com">Xero</a>, Microsoft, and the University of Auckland.<br /><br />

Before all of this I wrote boring enterprise software (mostly financial modelling software and business applications) for various companies in New Zealand.
