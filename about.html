I live and work in Wellington, New Zealand.

I am currently working on new projects with <a href="https://twitter.com/kapsy1312">@kapsy1312</a>.<br /><br />

In 2013 I was co-founder of a company called SocialBox.  We got funded by <a href="http://ycombinator.com">Y Combinator</a>.<br /><br />

Between 2010 and 2013, I was founder and CTO of <a href="http://www.playcomo.com">PlayCoMo</a>, a company that makes mobile phone games.<br /><br />

Before PlayCoMo I made indie mobile phone games under the moniker <a href="https://twitter.com/hackdirt/">@hackdirt</a>. I also built iOS apps for companies like Subway NZ, Pizza Hut, Wagamama, and Royal Bank of Scotland.
<br /><br />
From 2007 to 2008 I was lead developer at awesome education software startup <a href="http://www.learningsourcehq.com">Learning Source</a>. LS powers a training platform for a whole bunch of schools and companies in New Zealand and Australia, including <a href="http://events.xero.com">Xero</a>.<br /><br />

Before all of this I wrote financial modelling software and business applications for big faceless corporations.  I also dropped out of computer science grad school.
