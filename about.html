Since early 2014, I have been working on startup called <a href="http://www.vastvr.com">Vast</a> with <a href="https://twitter.com/kapsy1312">@kapsy1312</a>. Vast is a company that is making new tools for interacting with computers in virtual environments.<br /><br />

In 2013 I was co-founder of a company called SocialBox.  We got funded by <a href="http://ycombinator.com">Y Combinator</a>.<br /><br />

Between 2010 and 2013, I was founder and CTO of <a href="http://www.playcomo.com">PlayCoMo</a>, a company that makes mobile phone games.  I ran the company's office out of Wellington, New Zealand.<br /><br />

Before PlayCoMo I made indie mobile phone games under the moniker <a href="https://twitter.com/hackdirt/">@hackdirt</a>. I also built iOS apps for various companies in New Zealand, Australia, and the UK (including Subway NZ, Pizza Hut, Wagamama, and Royal Bank of Scotland).
<br /><br />
From 2007 to 2008 I was lead developer at awesome education software startup <a href="http://www.learningsourcehq.com">Learning Source</a>. LS powers a training platform for a whole bunch of schools and companies in New Zealand and Australia, including <a href="http://events.xero.com">Xero</a>.<br /><br />

Before all of this I wrote financial modelling software and business applications for various companies in New Zealand.
