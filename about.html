title: About Me
---

<p>
I live and work in Wellington, New Zealand.  I also frequently spend time in the San Francisco Bay Area on business.<br /><br />
I am currently working on new projects.<br /><br />

In 2013 I was co-founder of a company called SocialBox.  We got funded by <a href="http://ycombinator.com">Y Combinator</a>.<br /><br />

Between 2010 and 2013, I was founder and CTO of <a href="http://www.playcomo.com">PlayCoMo</a>, a company based in the USA that makes mobile phone games.<br /><br />

Before PlayCoMo I made indie mobile phone games under the moniker <a href="http://twitter.com/hackdirt/">@hackdirt</a>. I also built iOS apps for companies like Subway, Pizza Hut, Wagamama, and Royal Bank of Scotland.<br /><br />

Before this I was lead developer at awesome education software startup <a href="http://www.learningsource.co.nz">Learning Source</a>. LS powers the training and events platform for a whole bunch of companies, including <a href="https://events.xero.com">Xero</a>.<br /><br />

And, before all this I wrote boring financial modelling software and business applications for big faceless corporations.
